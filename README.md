# Live-LOL-Tracker
## League of Legends Overlay

A web application that displays League of Legends player statistics, live match information, and build widgets.

## Wireframe

The wireframe for the project includes the following elements:![alt text](<wireframe/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 12.24.53â€¯AM.png>)

- **White box**: Summoners spells/ultimate ability cooldown timers
- **Black box**: Champion splash art
- **Yellow box**: Ward trinket timer
- **Timer (white text)**: Jungle camp/dragon/baron timers

## Acceptance Criteria

- When a player opens the webpage, they are prompted to put in their username.
- When a player enters their username, they are directed to a page with their stats.
- When a player clicks "live match", they are directed to a page that dynamically displays in-game stats over a "League of Legends" mini map and suggested build and skill path for their picked champion.
- When a player finishes a match, they are directed to an after game stat review page.
- The mini map should update as the game plays out to show accurate timers.
- A user should be able to see timers tracking summoners spells and ultimate abilities of their teammates.
- A user should not have to reload the browser.
- A user should be able to log in.

## Example Web Page for User Stats

## Research

- How do other overlay apps get their builds/win/matchup stats?
